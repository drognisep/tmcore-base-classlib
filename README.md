# tmcore-base-classlib
Task management core functionality

This is meant as a base class library for the following feature points:
* __Communication__ - I would like to add support for structured communication with server(s) by means of callbacks and TCP. This is also necessary for synchronization of User and Task data.
* __Users__ - Registration, authentication, and capabilities management is the second feature to implement in this project as all features except communication rely on this being present.
* __Tasks__ - The basic framework for task creation, assignment, and management.
